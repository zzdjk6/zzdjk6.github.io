            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After some tries, I finally choose Sculpin as my blog engine.</p>

<p>As you know, a lot of programmer may go through these events:
1. sign up on a common blog site and write
2. then set up a standalone blog with dedicated domain (e.g use wordpress)
3. finally find a static site generator (e.g jekyll) and put the blog on Github Pages or sth like that.</p>

<p>I have a quickview of some static site generators, include Ruby-based (jekyll),
Javascript-based (Hexo), Python-based (Pelican), Java-based (jBake) then finally PHP-based (Sculpin).</p>

<p>I was a contract web developer with PHP as main weapon.
Before that I wrote some Python, ASP.net, and some Core java.</p>

<p>Ruby-based, Python-based and Javascript-based solutions got a lot user base,
but I find these solutions not fit me, because:
* It seems has all features I need.(jBake sucks, sorry :)
* It seems easier to cusomize since I feel more confident when using a tool written in a language I'm most skillfull.
* Recently I find myself don't like these dynamic-typed language without explict type hint any more (e.g Ruby,Python,Js).
* I find only PHP-based solutions all target at the same template engine in common - Twig,
it's de facto standard in Symfony-based community. Template engine of other language based solution vary
from each other. Too much choice drives me crazy.</p>

<p>If you have the similar problem with me, give Sculpin a try.</p>
